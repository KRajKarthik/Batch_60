The need for process simplicity extends to the institutional architecture as well. The ultimate 
source of supervision is public scrutinty and public leadership. Since it is not possible for the 
public to scrutinize everything, the focus should be on a strong but limited state, rather than 
weak and all pervasive state. This is in line with government’s idea of ‘Minimum Government 
and Maximum Governnance’. Since Independence, a plethora of autonomous bodies had 
proliferated. There is a need to prune them consistently not just from a cost perspective but in 
order to maintain transparency, accountability and efficient supervision. In this spirit, in the last 
year several organizations including All India Handloom Board, All India Handicrafts Board, 
Cotton Advisory Board and Jute Advisory Board have been closed. Similarly, the governement 
approved merger of four of its film media units, namely Films Division, Directorate of Film 
Festivals, National Film Archives of India, and Children’s Film Society, India into the National 
Film Development Corporation (NFDC) Ltd. 
6.37 Finally, there is a case for enacting Transparency of Rules Act to end any asymmetry 
of information regarding rules and regulations faced by a citizen. This was initially proposed 
in Chapter 8 of Economic Survey 2016-17 Volume 2. The reform solves for the problem that 
rules frequently change and often the citizen has to follow a long paper trail of circulars and 
notifications to know the current requirements. Under this act, all departments will need to 
mandatorily place all citizen-facing rules on their website. Officials will not be able to impose 
any rule not explicitly mentioned on the website clearly. Further, all laws, rules and regulations 
will have to be presented as an updated, unified whole at all times. This will bring transparency 
and simplify the understanding of regulations.
